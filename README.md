In this project we will be factoring the uncertainty in our machine learning
model estimates. Instead of conventional point estimates, we will be treating
our predictions as a random variable. By doing so, we will be getting estimates
on variance of our prediction. Furthermore, we will be combining the function
approximation power of Deep learning models with the uncertainty estimation prowess
of probabilistic graphical models.


Like any machine learning pipeline, we 'll be having the following major step
1. Data pre-processing- Convert raw data into feature vector
2. Learn a model
3. Evaluate model
4. Deploy the model as an api.

Here the difference is that the model outputs a random variable instead of
point estimate.
